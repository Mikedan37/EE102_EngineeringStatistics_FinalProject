- Correlation coefficients range from -1 (strong negative) to 1 (strong positive).
- Identify the strongest relationships for modeling.

Key Observations from the Correlation Matrix :
	1.	Correlation with GDP:
	•	Human Capital Index (HCI): Correlation = 0.234. Among the variables, HCI has the highest positive correlation with GDP. While weak, it suggests a slight relationship between a country’s human capital and its GDP.
	•	Global Competitiveness Index (GCI): Correlation = 0.192. GCI shows a weaker correlation with GDP, implying a minor relationship.
	•	Global Innovation Index (GII): Correlation = 0.182. GII is weakly correlated with GDP.
	•	World Governance Index (WGI): Correlation = 0.060. This variable has almost no correlation with GDP.
	•	Natural Resources Rents (NRR): Correlation = -0.134. A small negative correlation suggests that higher reliance on natural resources might slightly suppress GDP growth.
	2.	Relationships Among Input Variables:
	•	GII and HCI: Correlation = 0.837. Strong positive correlation, indicating that countries with higher innovation also tend to have better human capital.
	•	WGI and GII: Correlation = 0.800. Another strong positive correlation, showing that better governance is linked to higher innovation.
	•	HCI and GCI: Correlation = 0.541. A moderate correlation indicates some relationship between competitiveness and human capital.
	•	NRR and Other Variables: Generally negative correlations with all other variables, suggesting that countries relying on natural resources may underperform in these areas.

Insights from the Scatter Plot Matrix
	1.	HCI vs. GDP:
	•	The scatter plot shows a weak positive trend, consistent with the correlation coefficient (0.234). However, the relationship is not very strong, and other factors likely influence GDP more significantly.
	2.	NRR vs. GDP:
	•	The scatter plot suggests a slight downward trend, reflecting the small negative correlation (-0.134). Countries with higher natural resource rents might have lower GDPs due to over-reliance on resources and limited diversification.
	3.	WGI vs. GDP:
	•	The scatter plot shows no clear pattern, matching the weak correlation coefficient (0.060). Governance alone does not appear to strongly affect GDP.
	4.	GCI and GII vs. GDP:
	•	The scatter plots for GCI and GII show some clustering but lack clear trends. Their correlations with GDP (0.192 and 0.182) are weak, confirming this observation.

Key Takeaways for Modeling
	1.	Most Relevant Input Variables:
	•	Focus on Human Capital Index (HCI), as it has the highest positive correlation with GDP (0.234). While weak, it’s the most promising among the available variables.
	•	Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) and Global Innovation Index (GII) could also be included due to their modest correlations with GDP (0.192 and 0.182, respectively).
	2.	Exclude Less Relevant Variables:
	•	World Governance Index (WGI) and Natural Resources Rents (NRR) have little to no meaningful correlation with GDP. Consider excluding them from the initial models unless they improve performance.
	3.	Insights for Future Models:
	•	The strong correlations among input variables (e.g., GII and HCI, GII and WGI) suggest potential multicollinearity. If these variables are included together in a model, regularization techniques (e.g., Ridge or Lasso regression) may be needed to handle redundancy.

Recommendations
	1.	Document Key Observations:
	•	Include the scatter plot matrix and correlation coefficients in your report.
	•	Highlight that HCI, GCI, and GII are the most relevant predictors for GDP based on the data.
	2.	Build Initial Models:
	•	Use HCI, GCI, and GII as predictors in linear or heuristic models.
	•	Test excluding NRR and WGI to simplify the models.
	3.	Explore Non-Linear Relationships:
	•	The weak correlations suggest that linear models might not fully capture the relationships. Consider polynomial terms or interaction effects between HCI, GCI, and GII.
