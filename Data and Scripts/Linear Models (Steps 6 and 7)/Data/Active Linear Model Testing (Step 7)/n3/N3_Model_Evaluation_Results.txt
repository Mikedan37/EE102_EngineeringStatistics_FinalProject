Key Components in the Results
	1.	Model: The input variables used for the model: GCI, GII, and HCI.
	2.	Coefficients: [0.0078746, 0.00103562, 0.01298983]
	•	Indicates the impact of each variable on the output (GDP):
	•	For every 1-unit increase in GCI (Global Competitiveness Index), the predicted GDP increases by 0.00787 units, assuming GII and HCI remain constant.
	•	For every 1-unit increase in GII (Global Innovation Index), the predicted GDP increases by 0.00104 units, assuming GCI and HCI remain constant.
	•	For every 1-unit increase in HCI (Human Capital Index), the predicted GDP increases by 0.01299 units, assuming GCI and GII remain constant.
	3.	Intercept: 0.01779478867765881
	•	Represents the predicted GDP value when all input variables (GCI, GII, HCI) are zero.
	4.	Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.005880103386903876
	•	Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted GDP values. A lower MSE indicates better model performance. However, this value is comparable to the MSEs from the n=2 models, suggesting limited improvement.
	5.	R² (coefficient of determination): -0.12844926659532652
	•	Indicates how well the model explains the variability in GDP. The negative value suggests that the model performs worse than simply predicting the mean of GDP, highlighting poor predictive performance.

Observations
	1.	Small Coefficients:
	•	The coefficients are small, particularly for GII (0.00104), indicating a weak relationship between GII and GDP in this dataset.
	•	The largest coefficient is for HCI (0.01299), suggesting that HCI has the most significant impact on GDP among the three input variables.
	2.	Negative R²:
	•	The R² value is negative, indicating that the model does not effectively explain the variability in GDP. It performs worse than simply predicting the average GDP for all samples.
	3.	MSE:
	•	The MSE (0.00588) is slightly better than the MSEs for the n=2 models, but the improvement is minimal.

Implications
	1.	Weak Predictive Power:
	•	Despite including all three variables, the model’s R² value remains negative, suggesting that the input variables (GCI, GII, HCI) do not sufficiently explain GDP variability in this dataset.
	2.	HCI’s Stronger Influence:
	•	Among the three variables, HCI (Human Capital Index) consistently has the largest positive coefficient, indicating a stronger relationship with GDP.
	3.	Limited Improvement:
	•	Adding more variables (from n=1 to n=3) did not significantly reduce MSE or improve R², suggesting that these variables alone may not be adequate predictors of GDP.

Recommendations
	1.	Data Exploration:
	•	Investigate the dataset for noise, outliers, or insufficient variability, which might explain the poor model performance.
	•	Check correlations between the input variables and GDP to assess their predictive power.
	2.	Additional Variables:
	•	Consider incorporating additional variables that might have a stronger influence on GDP, such as trade balance, population, or industrial output.
	3.	Nonlinear Models:
	•	Explore nonlinear regression techniques or machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, random forests) to capture potential nonlinear relationships.
	4.	Feature Engineering:
	•	Create interaction terms or transform variables (e.g., log or square transformations) to enhance their predictive power.
