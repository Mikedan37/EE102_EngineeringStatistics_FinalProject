Model Interpretations

1. Model: GCI
	•	Coefficients: 0.01687566
	•	For every 1-unit increase in GCI (Global Competitiveness Index), the predicted GDP increases by 0.01688 units.
	•	Intercept: 0.019200235912278547
	•	If GCI is zero, the predicted GDP would be 0.0192 units.
	•	MSE: 0.00590063469748141
	•	The average squared difference between actual and predicted GDP is 0.0059.
	•	R²: -0.1323894254686555
	•	The negative R² indicates the model explains less variance than a simple mean-based prediction. In other words, the model is not effective in explaining the variability of GDP using GCI alone.

2. Model: GII
	•	Coefficients: 0.01582294
	•	For every 1-unit increase in GII (Global Innovation Index), the predicted GDP increases by 0.01582 units.
	•	Intercept: 0.019673167015119113
	•	If GII is zero, the predicted GDP would be 0.01967 units.
	•	MSE: 0.005819523922559907
	•	The average squared difference between actual and predicted GDP is 0.0058.
	•	R²: -0.11682347575261054
	•	The negative R² indicates the model is performing poorly. It is worse than a simple mean-based prediction in explaining GDP variability using GII.

3. Model: HCI
	•	Coefficients: 0.016152
	•	For every 1-unit increase in HCI (Human Capital Index), the predicted GDP increases by 0.01615 units.
	•	Intercept: 0.021535306800049128
	•	If HCI is zero, the predicted GDP would be 0.02154 units.
	•	MSE: 0.005861194390631458
	•	The average squared difference between actual and predicted GDP is 0.00586.
	•	R²: -0.12482044554037897
	•	Like the other models, the negative R² shows poor performance in explaining GDP variability compared to using the mean of GDP.

Key Observations
	1.	Low R² Values:
	•	All three models (GCI, GII, HCI) have negative R² values, indicating that the models are not effective at explaining the variability in GDP.
	•	Negative R² means the model predictions are worse than simply using the mean of the actual GDP values.
	2.	Similar MSE Values:
	•	The MSE values for all three models are similar (~0.0058), which suggests comparable performance in terms of prediction accuracy, but the models fail to explain variability.
	3.	Coefficients and Relationships:
	•	All coefficients are positive, indicating a direct (positive) relationship between each variable (GCI, GII, HCI) and GDP.
	•	However, the magnitude of these coefficients is small, suggesting that these variables have a weak influence on GDP in this dataset.

Implications
	•	The models are not good predictors of GDP using the given input variables (GCI, GII, or HCI).
	•	The negative R² values suggest that there may be other significant factors missing from the model that could better explain the variability in GDP.
	•	Further analysis, such as including additional variables, improving data quality, or testing for nonlinear relationships, might improve the models.

Next Steps
	1.	Investigate Data Quality:
	•	Check if there are outliers, missing data, or issues in how the variables were normalized or calculated.
	2.	Add More Variables:
	•	Combine multiple variables (e.g., GCI + GII, or all three variables) to see if a multi-variable model performs better.
	3.	Test Nonlinear Models:
	•	GDP may not have a linear relationship with these variables. Test other models like polynomial regression or decision trees.
