Key Components
	1.	Model:

f(\text{GCI}, \text{GII}, \text{HCI}) = a \cdot \text{GCI}^2 + b \cdot \text{GII} + c \cdot \text{HCI}^2 + d \cdot \text{GCI} \cdot \text{GII} + e

	•	This is a non-linear model that includes quadratic terms (\text{GCI}^2, \text{HCI}^2), an interaction term (\text{GCI} \cdot \text{GII}), and a constant term (e).
	2.	Optimized Coefficients:
	•	a (GCI²): -0.000953710577931045
	•	A small negative coefficient, indicating a slight inverse quadratic relationship between GCI and GDP.
	•	b (GII): -0.0004332436849315756
	•	A small negative coefficient, suggesting a weak inverse relationship between GII and GDP.
	•	c (HCI²): 0.00886028136608203
	•	The largest positive coefficient, indicating that HCI² has the most significant positive impact on GDP.
	•	d (GCI × GII): -0.0003043811870424573
	•	A small negative interaction effect between GCI and GII on GDP.
	•	e (Intercept): 0.05308882885591878
	•	The constant term, representing the baseline GDP when all input variables are zero.
	3.	Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.005210046438719207
	•	This measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted GDP values.
	•	A lower MSE indicates better performance.

Observations
	1.	HCI² is the Most Influential Term:
	•	The coefficient for HCI² (0.00886) is significantly larger than the coefficients for other terms, indicating that the quadratic effect of HCI (Human Capital Index) is the most important factor in predicting GDP in this model.
	2.	Negative Coefficients for GCI and GII:
	•	The negative coefficients for GCI², GII, and the interaction term (GCI \cdot GII) suggest that these variables have weak or slightly adverse effects on GDP in this dataset.
	3.	Improved MSE:
	•	The MSE of the heuristic model (0.00521) is lower than the MSEs for the linear models (n=1, n=2, and n=3 combinations), suggesting that the heuristic model provides better predictions than the linear models derived earlier.
	4.	Complexity of the Model:
	•	The inclusion of quadratic and interaction terms adds complexity to the model. However, the reduction in MSE justifies this added complexity.

Interpretation
	•	The heuristic model performs better than the linear models in terms of MSE, likely due to its ability to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between the input variables.
	•	The strong positive effect of HCI² suggests that the quadratic effect of the Human Capital Index is crucial for predicting GDP, highlighting the importance of investing in human capital for economic growth.

Recommendations
	1.	Use the Heuristic Model:
	•	Given the lower MSE, the heuristic model is a better predictor of GDP compared to the linear models.
	2.	Explore Additional Terms:
	•	You could experiment with higher-order terms (e.g., GII^2, HCI \cdot GII) or non-linear transformations (e.g., logarithmic or exponential terms) to further reduce the MSE.
	3.	Validate on New Data:
	•	Test the heuristic model on a new dataset to ensure its predictive power generalizes beyond the current data.
	4.	Refine HCI’s Role:
	•	Since HCI² has the most significant positive impact, consider exploring its individual contributions in greater detail to understand its role in GDP growth.
